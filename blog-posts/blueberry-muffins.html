            <p>
                A few days ago we had some nice, sunny weather and my son asked me if we could start up the grill to
                have
                bratwursts for dinner. While rooting around in the freezer, I found 3 big bags of blueberries.
                After joking with my family about how much blueberries we have, we decided we had to make blueberry
                muffins.
            </p>
            <p>
                My son found a <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/frozen-blueberry-muffins/">great
                blueberry muffin recipe</a> for
                frozen blueberries. We could only find one muffin pan so we decided to make a half batch. I was
                amazed how well they turned out.
