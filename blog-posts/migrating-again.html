                    <p>
                        During the commotion of switching to working from home and the University switching to online classes,
                        our team has been busy supporting groups needing urgent communications and our Tier 2 support people who were overwhelmed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that things have calmed down, we are able to get back to working on migrating sites from Drupal 7 to 8.
                        We have more 750 sites left to move and about a year to get the working done so it is good to be moving back to our primary responsiblities.
