            <h2>Beginning to Migrate Sites Again</h2>
            <article class="description">
                <p>
                    During the commotion of switching to working from home and the University switching to online classes, 
                    our team has been busy supporting groups needing urgent communications and our Tier 2 support people who were overwhelmed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that things have calmed down, we are able to get back to working on migrating sites from Drupal 7 to 8.  
                    We have more 750 sites left to move and about a year to get the working done so it is good to be moving back to our primary responsiblities.
                </p>
