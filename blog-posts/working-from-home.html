                <article class="description">
                    My whole family has been working from home since the middle of March.  As a whole, we've been able to make it work.  While I took of my son's desk, he has been working
                    in other random places through out the house.  Sometimes I'll find him in the kitchen, other times working in his bed.  My other son has taken possession of my wife's
                    desk displacing her to the couch.  Regardless, after more than 3 weeks of us sharing the house, we are getting along ok.
