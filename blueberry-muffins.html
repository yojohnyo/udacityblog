            <h2>Blueberry Muffins</h2>
            <article class="description">
                <p>
                    A few days ago we had some nice, sunny weather and my son asked me if we could start up the grill to have 
                    bratwursts for dinner.  While rooting around in the freezer, I found 3 big bags of blueberries.
                    After joking with my family about how much blueberries we have, we decided we had to make blueberry muffins. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My son found a <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/frozen-blueberry-muffins/">great blueberry muffin recipe</a> for 
                    frozen blueberries.  We could only find one muffin pan so we decided to make a half batch.  I was amazed how well they turned out.
