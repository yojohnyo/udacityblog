            <h2>About My Family</h2>
            <article class="description">
                My name is John Starr and I live in Minnesota with my wife, 2 kids and a dog.  When we are not traveling (which unfortunately is too often)
                we spend our time taking the dog for walks, playing board games among ourselves and / or friends and working around the house.
                I am a life long competitive swimmer (I started training when I was about 8 years old) and if COVID-19 lets up in time, I hope to do some
                open water swims this year.

                The kids and I have never made blueberry muffins before so we decided to give it a try.  We only made half a batch and they disappeared too quickly.

                Now that we are all stuck at home, we are stuck trying to find a new normal.  To keep themselves busy my kids baked themselves a cake.
