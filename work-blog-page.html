                I have worked for the University of Minnesota for more than 20 years.  I started working on their level 1 & 2 helplines and moved on to 
                doing training then business analyst.  While I was working as a buisiness analyst, I was tasked with replacing the University's 
                content management system.  We ended up choosing Drupal.  During the implementation, I became heaviliy involved with rolling it out and learned
                quite a bit along the way.  In the last 5 years, I've managed our Drupal contracts and done quite a bit of back end development.
                Most recently I developed a complex set of  migrations from Drupal 7 (using panelizer) to Drupal 8 using Layout Builder.
                I'm hoping to expand my role and opportunities by taking on front end development as well.

                During the commotion of switching to working from home and the University switching to online classes, our team has been busy supporting groups needing
                urgent communications and our Tier 2 support people who were overwhelmed.  We are finally able to get back to migrating sites.

                Now that we are all stuck at home, we are stuck trying to find a new normal.  To keep themselves busy my kids baked themselves a cake.
