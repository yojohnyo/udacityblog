            <h2>Why Backpacking?</h2>
            <article class="description">
                I first went backpacking in the early 90's while I was in college and fell in love with it right away.
                When I reached an impass in my career in 1998 and wasn't sure what I should do with the next chapter of my life, I decided to
                take a year off from work and thru hike the whole 2153 miles of the Appalachian Trail.  I is an experience which has stuck with me ever since
                and I dream of returning for another thru hike when I retire.  In the mean time, I have to content myself with backpacking
                every year or two providing that time and my health permit me to.

                The kids and I have never made blueberry muffins before so we decided to give it a try.  We only made half a batch and they disappeared too quickly.

                <div class="post-meta">April 3, 2020</div>
                My older son and I decided that we were going to try to hike the entire 93 miles of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/the-wonderland-trail.htm">
                Wonderland Trail</a> this summer.  The number of permits is limited and the competition to get them is tough.
