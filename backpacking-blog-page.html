                <article class="description">
                    I first went backpacking in the early 90's while I was in college and fell in love with it right away.
                    When I reached an impass in my career in 1998 and wasn't sure what I should do with the next chapter of my life, I decided to
                    take a year off from work and thru hike the whole 2153 miles of the Appalachian Trail.  I is an experience which has stuck with me ever since
                    and I dream of returning for another thru hike when I retire.  In the mean time, I have to content myself with backpacking
                    every year or two providing that time and my health permit me to.

                    My older son and I decided that we were going to try to hike the entire 93 miles of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/the-wonderland-trail.htm">
                    Wonderland Trail</a> this summer.  The number of permits is limited and the competition to get them is tough.
