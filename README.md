# Udacity Front End Web Developer Blog Project
## John Starr - yojohnyo1@gmail.com

This repository contains my FED blog project.
There are 3 sub directories -
   - img which contains images
   - blog-posts which contains individual posts
   - css containing the CSS files
      - Note that styles.css consolidates the other css files
   
The main directory contains:
   - index.html - the home page
   - styles.html - demonstrations of the styling for different text formats
   - blog category summary pages
   
I look forward to receiving your feedback on this project.
